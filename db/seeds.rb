#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

answer1 = Answer.create(author_id: kevin.id ,question_id: quest1.id, body:"In jQuery, you design a page, and then you make it dynamic. This is because jQuery was designed for augmentation and has grown incredibly from that simple premise. But in AngularJS, you must start from the ground up with your architecture in mind. Instead of starting by thinking I have this piece of the DOM and I want to make it do X, you have to start with what you want to accomplish, then go about designing your application, and then finally go about designing your view.

answer3 = Answer.create(author_id: ari.id ,question_id: quest2.id, body: "Depending on your use case, you may want to format the date in the application receiving the response rather than in the response itself. This will keep your RABL templates decoupled from the final rendering of the date and thus more easily consumable.")
